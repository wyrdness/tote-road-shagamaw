      "summary": "A bizarre hybrid creature with a moose's front half and a bear's rear half, walking with different legs suited to different terrain types.",
      "full": "The Tote-Road Shagamaw is one of the most absurdly designed fearsome critters. This creature has the front half of a moose and the rear half of a bear, creating an anatomically ridiculous hybrid. The front legs are moose hooves while the back legs have bear paws. According to the tall tales, this unique configuration allows the Shagamaw to travel along tote roads (logging roads) more efficiently, with each set of legs adapted to different terrain. The moose front handles one side while the bear rear handles the other. The creature represents the fearsome critter tradition's love of impossible hybrid animals that mock the very concept of adaptation."
